# Benchmarks Directory

This directory contains C/C++ source files for benchmarking Intel CPU and iGPU performance.

## Structure
- `src/` - Source code for benchmark applications
- `include/` - Header files
- `build/` - Build artifacts (should be added to .gitignore)

## Guidelines
1. Each benchmark should be self-contained and well-documented
2. Include build instructions in each benchmark's directory
3. Use consistent naming conventions for source files
4. Document hardware requirements and dependencies
